Mule 4 introduces many changes, so plan accordingly before attempting to migrate from Mule 3.

[[when_to_start]]
== When to Start Using Mule 4

MuleSoft recommends that you develop all *new* projects on Mule 4, provided that:

* You and your team have updated your skills for Mule 4 through the documentation or formal training.
* You have the <<prepare_dev_environ, proper deployment environment>>.

For projects deployed on Mule 3, use the Mule Migration Assistant (MMA) to avoid re-creating the application in Mule 4.

Migrate your applications if any one of the following conditions is met:

* The 3.x version you are using reaches end of life.
* You want to make significant updates to the existing applications.
* You want to take advantage of key Mule 4 capabilities.
* You decide to upgrade all your apps to Mule 4 because your organization requires all apps to be on one version (for some on-prem scenarios).

== Setting up Your Local Development Environment

First, you need to download Studio 7 and install it. If you're deploying locally, you also need to download the Mule 4 standalone runtime, if the runtime that comes with Studio does not match the one you want to use for runtime purposes.

== Getting Ready to Deploy
Next, you need to make sure your deployment environment is ready. Depending on which environment you have, different steps may be required.
