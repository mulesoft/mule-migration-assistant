= Perform a Migration to Mule 4
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

MuleSoft recommends that you follow this migration path from Mule 3 to Mule 4.

[[min_reqs]]
== Requirements

Minimum requirements for a migrated app:

* Studio 7.2.x (with support for Mule Runtime 4.1.3 or above).
+
You can check your Studio version by navigating to
*Anypoint Studio -> About Anypoint Studio*.

The Mule Migration Assistant (MMA) helps migrate Mule apps that use these versions
of the Mule runtime:

* 3.9.x
* 3.8.x

See also, <<unsupported_projects>>.

[[recommendations]]
== Recommended Mule 4 Version

MMA supports migrations to Mule 4.2.0 and higher, but MuleSoft recommends that you migrate to a minimum of Mule 4.3.0 to take advantage of significant enhancements to performance and stability.

[[premigration_tasks]]

== Pre-Migration Tasks

If your app is using DataMapper, MuleSoft recommends that you migrate to DataWeave
_before_ running the Mule Migration Assistant (MMA). See <<datamapper>>.

[[run_tool]]
== Running the Mule Migration Assistant

Mule Migration Assistant (MMA) is a command-line
utility (packaged as an executable JAR file).

Note that the xref:migration-tutorial.adoc[Mule Migration Tutorial] covers the
use of the MMA, as well as post-migration tasks, on a sample Mule 3 application.

To run the Mule Migration Assistant:

. Make sure that the required software is installed
(see <<min_reqs, Requirements>>).
. Unzip the MMA `mule-migration-assistant-runner-1.0.0.zip` file.
+
See the download URL in xref:migration-tutorial.adoc#prereqs[Prerequisites].
+
The Zip file contains `mule-migration-assistant-runner-1.0.0.jar` and a `libs`
subdirectory with a number of MMA-related JAR files that provide MMA resources.
+
. In your console, provide a command that specifies all the required <<options>>,
for example:
+
.Command-line Invocation
[source,console,linenums]
----
$ java -jar mule-migration-assistant-runner-1.0.0.jar \
 -projectBasePath /Users/me/AnypointStudio/workspace-studio/my-v6-project \
 -muleVersion 4.3.0 \
 -destinationProjectBasePath /Users/me/my-dir/my-migrated-project
----
+
Note that for `-destinationProjectBasePath` option, the folder (for example,
`my-migrated-project`) in which to place the migrated must _not_ exist. The MMA
will create it. If you point to a folder that exists already, the migration will
fail an error like this: `Exception: Destination folder already exists.`
+
If your app is associated with a domain, you also need to set the <<options, parentDomainBasePath>> option.
+
When MMA runs successfully, you will see a message something like this:
+
.Successful Migration
[source,console,linenums]
----
Executing migration...
...
========================================================
MIGRATION SUCCESS
========================================================
Total time: 11.335 s
Migration report:
/Users/me/my-dir/my-migrated-project/report/summary.html
----
+
. Import the project to a supported version of Studio
(see <<min_reqs, Requirements>>).
+
In Studio, you can import the project by going to *File -> Import*, then from the
dialog that opens, *Anypoint Studio -> Anypoint Studio Project from File System*.
+
. Open and check the Migration report (`summary.html`) at the path provided in
the console output  (under your
  `_destinationProjectBasePath_/report/summary.html`).
+
To understand errors and warnings in the Migration report, see
xref:migration-report.adoc[Mule Migration Report].
+
Also note that the same information is provided as comments in the
Mule Configuration XML files for your project that the MMA outputs.
+
. Address the errors in the report, and address the warnings before deploying
the migrated app to a production environment.
+
The migrated app will not run in Studio if there are any unresolved
errors in it.
+
The xref:migration-tool.adoc#compatibility_module[Compatibility module] can work
around warnings until you or your team can address them with permanent fixes.
However, addressing the warnings is important for improving the performance of
the flows, so you should treat warnings the same way you treat errors before you
deploy your app to a production environment.
+
For guidance with errors on unsupported connectors, see <<migrating_unsupported_connectors>>.
+
. Identify and consider additional migration steps where the automated migration
by the MMA can be improved. See
xref:migration-tool-post-mig.adoc[Post-Migration Tasks] and
<<devkit>>.
+
This step includes removing Compatibility module components from the project XML.
+
. Run any migrated MUnit tests.
+
See <<munit, Testing the Migrated App>>.

[[domains]]
== Domains

For domains and applications included in that domain, an MMA execution is needed for each artifact (the domain and each app).

. For the migration of the domain, run MMA as you would for an app:
+
.Command-line Invocation
[source,console,linenums]
----
$ java -jar mule-migration-assistant-runner-1.0.0.jar \
 -projectBasePath /Users/me/AnypointStudio/workspace-studio/my-v6-domain-project \
 -muleVersion 4.3.0 \
 -destinationProjectBasePath /Users/me/my-dir/my-migrated-domain-project
----
+
. For each application that belongs to that domain, run MMA with an additional parameter, `parentDomainBasePath`, that points to the unmigrated parent domain:
+
.Command-line Invocation
[source,console,linenums]
----
$ java -jar mule-migration-assistant-runner-1.0.0.jar \
 -projectBasePath /Users/me/AnypointStudio/workspace-studio/my-v6-project \
 -parentDomainBasePath /Users/me/AnypointStudio/workspace-studio/my-v6-domain-project \
 -muleVersion 4.3.0 \
 -destinationProjectBasePath /Users/me/my-dir/my-migrated-project
----

[[options]]
== Command-line Options

The Mule Migration Assistant (MMA) is a command-line tool. You simply input a
Mule 3 project and target version and then output the results.

.Command-line Options
[cols="2,3"]
|===
| `-destinationProjectBasePath <arg>` | Required. Directory for the migrated
project that includes a destination folder for the migrated project, for
example, `/path/to/my/destination-folder`. The MMA will create the
`destination-folder`. It will produce an error if `destination-folder` already
exists.
| `-help` | For displaying the help.
| `-muleVersion <arg>` | Required. The Mule version to which you are migrating: `4.3.0`. See <<recommendations>> for supported and recommended versions.
| `-parentDomainBasePath` <arg>| Required _only if the app is associated with a domain_.
| `-projectBasePath <arg>` a| Required. Directory of the project to migrate.

To discover the path to your Mule 3 project from Studio, you can go to
*File -> Switch Workspace -> Other...*, copy the path that appears in
the *Workspace* field. You need to append the name of your project
to that path when you use it as the `<arg>`
to `-projectBasePath`, for example:

`-projectBasePath /Users/me/AnypointStudio/workspace-studio/my-v6-project`
|===

Whenever the MMA adds an entry to the report (ERROR, WARNING, or INFO), the
same information is also added as a comment in the Configuration XML file for
the project.

[[munit]]
=== Testing the Migrated App

Automatic migration of MUnit tests is supported the Mule Migration Assistant
(MMA), so the first step is to run those migrated tests. Once all those tests
pass, you can perform any additional testing that you were
performing on the original version of the app.

In either case, expect some of these tests to fail. Manual intervention might
be required to deal with additional details that are not automatically handled
by the MMA.

[[datamapper]]
== Migrating from the DataMapper to DataWeave

DataMapper is not supported by the Mule Migration Assistant (MMA). However, you
can use the DataWeave Migrator _prior to running MMA_.

. Before migrating to Mule 4, migrate your DataMapper transformations to
DataWeave using the
https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-runtime/3.9/dataweave-migrator[DataWeave Migrator (external link)], which is available for Mule 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9.
. Run the MMA following instructions in <<run_tool>>.

[[migrating_unsupported_connectors]]
== Migrating Unsupported Connectors

When the Migration report produces the following ERROR, you need to
migrate the connector manually:

`The migration of _some-connector_ is not supported`

To manually migrate such a connector:

. https://docs.mulesoft.com/studio/7.5/add-modules-in-studio-to[Add the equivalent connector (external link)] for
Mule 4 to the app.
. Refer to the connector documentation for both Mule 3 and Mule 4 to determine
the correct mappings for the connector:
.. If the connector has a `config` element, add a new configuration that is
equivalent to that of the Mule 3 app.
.. Migrate the sources and inbound endpoints to the source that are provided
by the connector for Mule 4.
.. Migrate the operations and outbound endpoints to the operations provided
by the connector for Mule 4.
.. Migrate any expressions that use the inbound properties that are set by a
source or operation of a connector in Mule 3 to refer to the `attributes`,
instead.

For custom connectors built with DevKit, see <<devkit, Migrating Custom DevKit Connectors>>.

[[devkit]]
== Migrating Custom DevKit Connectors

Mule apps might contain custom-made DevKit connectors. Though the Mule Migration
Assistant (MMA) cannot migrate them, the
https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-sdk/1.1/dmt[DevKit Migrator (external link)]
is available to convert DevKit projects to Mule 4 SDK projects. After
migrating them, you then need to:

* Manually add the migrated modules to the Mule 4 app's `pom.xml`.
* Manually adapt all the uses of these migrated connectors.

[[unsupported_projects]]
== Migrating from Unsupported Runtime Versions

If you want to migrate apps that are currently running on unsupported
runtime versions such as 3.7.x, 3.6.x or before, you can still use MMA.
However, a greater ratio of migration errors, unsupported patterns, or
incorrect code generation is to be expected.

Although MuleSoft will not officially support these cases, it is probably a
good idea to try the Mule Migration Assistant on them anyway. Dealing
with limitations is likely to be easier than performing a completely unaided
migration.
