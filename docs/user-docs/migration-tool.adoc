= Using the Mule Migration Assistant to Support Migration to Mule 4
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]

This section provides guidance on migrating a Mule 3 app to Mule 4 with the
Mule Migration Assistant (MMA).

Important::
*Mule Migration Assistant (MMA) is subject to the terms and conditions described for https://www.mulesoft.com/legal/versioning-back-support-policy#community[Community] connectors.*

The migration process is a multi-part procedure, where you:

. Perform any pre-migration steps, such as migrating from the DataMapper to DataWeave.
. Run MMA on a Mule 3 project.
. Import the Mule 4 application that MMA produced into a supported version of Studio 7.
. Review the Migration report that MMA produced.
. Manually migrate what MMA cannot migrate automatically.
. Remove uses of Compatibility module components.
. Run any migrated MUnit tests.

These steps are detailed in xref:migration-tool-procedure.adoc[Perform a Migration to Mule 4]. However, before proceeding with a migration, you should:

* Review <<migration_tool>> and <<compatibility_module>>.
* Learn what the MMA migrates in <<supported_migrations>>.

[[migration_tool]]
== Mule Migration Assistant

The Mule Migration Assistant (MMA) automates part of the migration of Mule 3
apps to Mule 4. Though the MMA does not migrate the app entirely,
it provides significant help with these tasks:

* Migrating the project structure.
* Automatically creating descriptor files, such as `pom.xml` or `mule-artifact.json`.
* Automatically performing many adaptations of the appâ€™s code.
* Providing guidance on how to manually migrate components and patterns that cannot be migrated automatically.

MMA helps with such tasks, but it does not deliver a fully functional app. Some additional steps are required. Those steps include testing and can also include:

* Manual migration of unsupported components.
* Manual migration of complex MEL expressions to DataWeave that cannot be automatically converted by MMA.
* Manual migration of complex DataWeave transformations that cannot be automatically converted by MMA.
* Prior migration of the DataMapper with the _DataWeave_ Migration tool, before running the MMA.

It is also important to note that the MMA does not support incremental migrations.

Note that you can try out MMA by following the steps in the xref:migration-tutorial.adoc[Mule Migration Assistant Tutorial].

[[compatibility_module]]
== Compatibility Module

Important::
*The Compatibility module is subject to the terms and conditions described for https://www.mulesoft.com/legal/versioning-back-support-policy#community[Community] connectors.*

Some components or patterns cannot be migrated automatically by transforming
the app's XML. For such cases, MMA adds the Compatibility
module to your project. The Compatibility module provides a set of components that
either adapts Mule 3 components into the Mule 4 architecture, or in some cases,
enables some Mule 3 components to work in Mule 4.

*Important:* MuleSoft recommends that you migrate to a point where the
Compatibility module can be dropped from your app and that you only use the
module as a bridge until the manual steps of the migration are complete and your app is 100% compliant with Mule 4.

The Compatibility module does not cover every migration gap. Instead, it
complements MMA:

 * By providing MEL support for the cases where a MEL expression could not be
 migrated to DataWeave automatically.
 * By adapting the Mule 3 Message model to Mule 4.

You or your team need to handle other migration gaps that are covered in the xref:migration-report.adoc[Mule Migration report].

[[unsupported_connectors]]
== Unsupported Connectors

Connectors that are used in an application but not currently supported by MMA
generate the following ERROR in the Migration report:

`The migration of some-connector is not supported`

Such connectors require manual migration.

To manually migrate them, see xref:migration-tool-procedure#migrating_unsupported_connectors[Migrating Unsupported Connectors].
