= Post-Migration Tasks

The Mule Migration Assistant (MMA) performs migrations on individual components, connectors, and modules. In some cases, you can make improvements to the migrated app by taking into account the flow or project as a whole.

This section focuses on *recommended* post-migration tasks to perform after
using the MMA, incorporating the Compatibility module (see
xref:migration-tool.adoc[Migration to Mule 4]) as needed, and
performing any manual migration steps indicated in the Migration report.

[[mel_expressions]]
== MEL Expressions (Manual Post-Migration Steps)

Most MEL expressions are migrated to https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-runtime/4.3/dataweave[DataWeave (external link)] by the
Mule Migration Assistant (MMA). However, some operators and MEL constructs are
not supported by the MMA to generate the equivalent DataWeave automatically.

For example, the expressions in the next Output examples receive the `mel:` prefix from the MMA. The Compatibility module supports the MEL language from
Mule 3, so these expressions still work. The Manual Modification examples show
how to manually migrate the expressions in the Output examples to Mule 4.

* MEL `flowVars` become Mule event variables (`vars`) in DataWeave expressions.
+
.Example 1: MMA Output
[source]
----
#[mel:flowVars.booleanVar ? 1 : 0]
----
+
.Example 2: Manual Modification to MMA Output
[source]
----
#[if (vars.booleanVar) 1 else 0]
----
+
* The MEL map is a `HashMap` that contains a key-value pair. In DataWeave,
the same pair is a simple JSON object:
+
.Example 1: MMA Output
[source]
----
#[mel:Map m = new HashMap<>(); m.put(“key”, “value”); return m;]
----
+
.Example 2: Manual Modification MMA Output
[source]
----
#[{‘key’, ‘value’}]
----

=== Using the Scripting Module to Migrate procedural MEL Expressions

Some MEL expressions are not simply expressions but actually procedural scripts,
so they cannot be migrated seamlessly to a functional language such as DataWeave.
For these cases, you should use the
https://docs.mulesoft.com/scripting-module/1.1/[Scripting module (external link)] and
migrate the MEL script to a language supported by the Scripting module.

.Example: MMA Output
[source,XML,linenums]
----
<expression-component><![CDATA[
if(flowVars.fail) {
    throw new IllegalStateException(“var fail is set to true”);
} else {
    payload = “Some Result”;
}
]]></expression-component>
----

.Example: Manual Modification to MMA Output
[source,XML,linenums]
----
<script:execute engine="groovy">
    <script:code><![CDATA[
if(vars.fail) {
    throw new IllegalStateException(“var fail is set to true”);
} else {
    payload = “Some Result”;
}
    ]]></script:code>
</script:execute>
----

Note that the content might look similar because MEL and Groovy syntax are
both Java-based, but always test that the behavior of any migrated script
is maintained.

[[inbound_properties]]
== Inbound Properties (Manual Post-Migration Steps)

Instead of relying on the Compatibility module to handle inbound properties (see
https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-runtime/4.3/intro-mule-message#inbound-properties-are-now-attributes[Inbound Properties Are Now Attributes (external link)])
and on the `mel:` syntax to allow MEL expressions in Mule 4, it is recommended that you follow each of these steps on Mule Migration Assistant (MMA) output:

. Remove `<compatibility:attributes-to-inbound-properties/>` elements.
. Replace uses of `inboundProperties` in MEL expressions with a DataWeave 2.0 expression.
. Replace uses of `vars.compatibility_inboundProperties[‘propName’]` with a reference to a Message attribute value.

This example shows modifications to inbound properties from an HTTP listener:

.Example: MMA Output
[source,XML,linenums]
----
<http:listener config-ref="myHttp"/>
<compatibility:attributes-to-inbound-properties/>
<logger message="#[vars.compatibility_inboundProperties['http.request']]">
<logger message="#[mel:message.inboundProperties['http.request']]">
----

.Example: Manual Modification to MMA Output
[source,XML,linenums]
----
<http:listener config-ref="myHttp"/>
<logger message="#[message.attributes.requestPath]">
<logger message="#[message.attributes.requestPath]">
----

[[outbound_properties]]
== Outbound Properties (Manual Post-Migration Steps)

If an outbound property is _not_ set in a flow, you can safely remove any
usage of that outbound property (see
https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-runtime/4.3/intro-mule-message#outbound-properties[Outbound Properties (external link)]).
For example, you can remove the `status` attribute from an HTTP listener and
rely on the default for the listener _if_ an `http.status` outbound property is
never set in the flow.

If a property is set in the flow, you need to move the expression that sets the
property into the attribute of the operation or source where it is used. For
example, you might modify the XML output of the Mule Migration Assistant (MMA):

.Example: MMA Output
[source,XML,linenums]
----
<compatibility:set-property propertyName="http.method" value="#[if(get) 'GET' else 'PUT']"/>
...
<http:request config-ref="myHttp" method="#[vars.compatibility_outboundProperties['http.method']]"/>
----

The next example moves the expression that sets the `http.method` property
(shown in the example above) to the `method` attribute of the `http:request`
operation where it is used.

.Example: Manual Modification to MMA Output
[source,XML,linenums]
----
<http:request config-ref="myHttp" method="#[if(get) 'GET' else 'PUT']"/>
----

Note that in Mule 3, the outbound property can be set by any component or inside
a referenced flow. This kind of complexity makes the manual step necessary
because the MMA does not have the full context to interpret the semantics of an
app.

[[session_variables]]
== Session Properties (Manual Post-Migration Steps)

Transport barriers do not exist in Mule 4, so Session properties are no longer needed and have been removed from Mule 4. After running the
Mule Migration Assistant (MMA) on a Mule app that uses Session properties, you should store data in Mule event variables (`vars`).

To migrate Session properties to variables:

* Replace the Compatibility module's `compatibility:set-session-variable`
processors with Set Variable (`set-variable`) components, for example:
+
.Example: MMA Output with `compatibility:set-session-variable`
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow="sessionExampleFlow">
  <compatibility:set-session-variable variableName="token" value="1234" />
  <compatibility:outbound-properties-to-var/>
  <http:request config-ref="flowRequestConfig" method="GET" path="/">
    <http:headers>
        #[migration::HttpRequester::httpRequesterTransportHeaders(vars)]
    </http:headers>
  </http:request>
  <compatibility:attributes-to-inbound-properties/>
</flow>
----
+
The following manual modification that replaces both
`<compatibility:set-session-variable/>`
and `<compatibility:outbound-properties-to-var/>` configurations with
`<set-variable variableName="token" value="1234" />`. In the HTTP header (`<http:headers>`) setting `{'token': vars.token}` selects the value of that
variable.
+
.Example: Manual Modification with `set-variable`
[source,XML,linenums]
----
<flow="sessionExampleFlow">
  <set-variable variableName="token" value="1234" />
  <http:request config-ref="flowRequestConfig" method="GET" path="/">
    <http:headers>
      <!-- Because no outbound properties were set before this operation, you do
          not need the httpRequesterTransportHeaders function anymore -->
      #[{'token': vars.token}]
    </http:headers>
  </http:request>
</flow>
----
+
* Replace the Compatibility module's `compatibility:remove-session-variable` processors to `set-variable`, for example:
+
.Example: MMA Output with `compatibility:remove-session-variable`
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow="sessionExampleFlowListener">
  <http:listener config-ref="flowListenerConfig" path="/">
    <http:response statusCode="200">
      <http:headers>#[migration::HttpListener::httpListenerResponseHeaders(vars)]</http:headers>
    </http:response>
  </http:listener>
  <compatibility:attributes-to-inbound-properties/>
  <logger message="#[mel:sessionVars['token']]"/>
  <compatibility:remove-session-variable variableName="token" />
  <compatibility:outbound-properties-to-var/>
</flow>
----
+
The following manual modification replaces
`<compatibility:remove-session-variable variableName="token" />` with
`<set-variable variableName="token" value="1234" />` and uses the `token`
variable in the HTTP header, `#[{'token': vars.token}]`.
+
.Example: Manual Modification with `set-variable`
[source,XML,linenums]
----
<flow="sessionExampleFlowListener">
  <http:listener config-ref="flowListenerConfig" path="/">
    <http:response statusCode="301">
      <http:headers>#[migration::HttpListener::httpListenerResponseHeaders(vars)]</http:headers>
    </http:response>
  </http:listener>
  <set-variable variableName="token" value="#[message.attributes.headers.token]" />
  <logger message="#[vars.token]"/>
  <remove-variable variableName="token" />
</flow>
----
* Replace uses of the Session property in expressions with a variable, for
example, replacing `<logger message="#[mel:sessionVars['token']]"/>` with
`<logger message="#[vars.token]"/>`, as shown above.
* In the connectors migrated from transports (for example, File, VM, JMS, HTTP connectors), make sure to pass these migrated variables to the operation or the response builder (for example, within `<http:response/>`) of the source.
+
The way to accomplish this varies by connector. For HTTP, you can use headers
(`<http:headers/>`). For JMS, you can use message properties. For VM, you can
use the body expression.
+
* For sources that receive Session information, read the information as it was set on the previous step and set the needed variables.


[[inbound_attachments]]
== Inbound Attachments (Manual Post-Migration Steps)

Expressions that use inbound attachments should use the DataWeave features for
handling multipart data formats.

.Example: Mule 3
[source,MEL,linenums]
----
#[message.inboundAttachments.get('myAttachment').getDataSource().getInputStream()]
#[message.inboundAttachments.get('myAttachment').getDataSource().getContentType()]
#[message.inboundAttachments.get('myAttachment').getDataSource().getPart().getContentDispositionFilename()]
----

.Example: Mule 4 Modifications
[source,DataWeave,linenums]
----
#[payload.parts.myAttachment.content]
#[payload.parts.myAttachment.headers.'Content-Type']
#[payload.parts.myAttachment.headers.'Content-Disposition'.filename]
----

See https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-runtime/4.3/dataweave-formats-multipart[Multipart (Form-Data) (external link)].

[[outbound_attachments]]
== Outbound Attachments (Manual Post-Migration Steps)

Instead of configuring outbound attachments to send in the next operation of a
flow or in the response of the source, each operation and source must make
explicit any attachments that are sent. You can set attachments as variables
for later reference in an expression.

Refer to the documentation of each connector for details on how to declare
attachments to be sent. For example, see
https://docs.mulesoft.com/email-connector/1.2/email-list#getting-data-from-emails[Getting Data from Emails (external link)]
and the section on _Attachments_
in https://docs.mulesoft.com/web-service-consumer-connector/1.5/web-service-consumer-consume[Consume a Web Service - Mule 4 (external link)].

== Migrating Custom Metadata Types

The Mule Migration Assistant (MMA) does not migrate custom metadata types to
your migrated Mule app. So, after migrating to Mule 4, you need load the types
into any Transform Message components that use them in your migrated app.

The MMA automates part of this procedure by migrating any schema and example
files for these types from your Studio 6 project directories for
your Mule 3 app, such as `src/main/resources`.

*Prerequisite*: Please review sections on migrating Inbound and Outbound
properties, Session properties, Inbound and Outbound attachments,
and on
https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-runtime/4.3/migration-core-enricher[Migrating the Enricher to a Target Variable (external link)]
before starting this procedure. They cover important uses of Mule event
attributes and variables in a Mule 4 app.


To use custom data types in your migrated Studio 7 project:

. Open the migrated Mule 4 app in Studio 7.
. Use the Transform Message component in your Studio 7 project to load the
data structures that are defined through your custom data type files. You can
use these steps as a general guide to this process:
.. Double-click a Transform Message component in your Mule 4 app to open the
the *Transform Message* tab (located in the lower part of the default
Studio project window).
+
The columned input pane on the left supports custom metadata types for the
*Payload*, *Variables*, or *Attributes*.
+
.. Determine whether to create the custom metadata type for the payload, an
attribute, or a variable.
+
As described in previous sections, Mule 4 attributes replace Inbound properties.
Mule 4 event variables replace Mule 3 variables, such as Flow, Session, and
Record variables. They also replace the Message Enricher component.
+
https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-runtime/4.3/dataweave-quickstart#med_large_payload[This example (external link)], starting at step 4, loads the
content of an example JSON file as a custom metadata type for the payload
of a Mule message.
+
.. In the left-most column of the *Transform Message* tab, open the
*Select metadata type* dialog for the payload, attributes, or variables:
+
You can click *Define metadata* for  *Payload* or *Attributes* if they are
present, or you can simply right-click *Payload* or *Attributes*, then click
*Set Metadata* to open the *Select metadata type* dialog. The
+
For variables, you need to right-click *Variables*, click *New Variables*, then provide a variable name to open the *Select metadata type*.
+
. Now load your schema and example file (or files) for the custom date type
(or types) to the Transform Message component:
+
.. Click *+Add* to open the *Create new type* dialog.
.. In the dialog, provide a *Type id* for the schema or example, and click
*Create type*.
.. Back in the *Select metadata type* dialog that opens, select the appropriate
type from the *Type* drop-down menu (for example, *XML* or *JSON*).
.. Below the new type, select *Schema* or *Example*, whichever applies to your
custom metadata type.
.. Use the navigation button with the ellipsis (*...*) to locate the schema
or example file to use, and click *Open* to display the structure of the file
schema or example in the *Select metadata type* window.
+
Migrated files are typically in `src/main/resources`. In the unusual case that
your schema or example files were not stored in your Studio 6 project
directories (and therefore not migrated to your Mule 4 project directory), you
can try to find them elsewhere or recreate them, then use this step to
store them in the Studio 7 `src/main/resources` directory for your Mule 4
project.
+
.. Now click *Select* to load the example or schema file to use in this
Transform Message component.
.. Repeat these steps for each custom metadata type used by each
Transform Message component in your migrated app.

[[domain_connectors]]
== Domain Connectors (Manual Post-Migration Steps)

In Mule 3, inbound and outbound endpoints for some transports had
configurations that, in Mule 4, have moved to the connector. The `http`
and `vm` transports are examples. When the connector is declared in the
domain, the Mule Migration Assistant (MMA) that runs for the domain has no
visibility into the app or its endpoints. So the MMA cannot complete the
configuration of the connector, and the configuration must be completed
manually after all the apps in the domain have migrated.

.Example: Mule 3 Domain
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<https:polling-connector name="pollingConnector" pollingFrequency="30000" reuseAddress="true" checkEtag="false" discardEmptyContent="false">
    <https:tls-server path="trustStore" storePassword="mulepassword"/>
</https:polling-connector>
----

.Example: Mule 3 App
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<https:inbound-endpoint host="localhost" port="${port1}" connector-ref="pollingConnector"/>
----

.Example: Mule 4 Migrated Domain
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<http:request-config name="pollingConnectorConfig">
    <http:request-connection protocol="HTTPS">
        <tls:context>
            <tls:trust-store path="trustStore" password="mulepassword"/>
        </tls:context>
    </http:request-connection>
</http:request-config>
----

.Example: Mule 4 Domain Modifications
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<http:request-config name="pollingConnectorConfig">
<!-- The host and port are pulled up from the app, so they won't be available when just the domain is migrated. -->
  <http:request-connection protocol="HTTPS" host="localhost" port="${port1}">
    <tls:context>
      <tls:trust-store path="trustStore" password="mulepassword"/>
    </tls:context>
  </http:request-connection>
</http:request-config>
----

In the Mule 3 example above, the `port` is configured on the endpoint, so
when the connector is in a domain, it is necessary to migrate the Mule 4
configuration manually. Review the documentation of the equivalent Mule 3 and
Mule 4 connectors for details on migrating specific configurations.
