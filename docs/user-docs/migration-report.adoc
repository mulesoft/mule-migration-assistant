After migrating a Mule 3 app to Mule 4, the
xref:migration-tool#migration_tool.adoc[Mule Migration Assistant] (MMA) produces
a Migration report
that you can use to identify and perform any manual migration tasks that remain.
When the MMA detects something it cannot migrate, it provides feedback about the
problem and links to information about the steps you need to take. The assistant also
comments on and provides guidance for any cases that the MMA is able to migrate
without following the best practices.

Inside each migrated project, the MMA generates a report that
contains a list of migration errors and warnings, for example:

* Warning (`WARN`): For these issues, the Compatibility module can serve as a
temporary workaround until you migrate them manually.
* Error (`ERROR`): Issues that require a manual migration. There is no
workaround through the Compatibility module.
* Info (`INFO`): Messages about Mule 3 features that were removed or changed
to make use of Mule 4 improvements. You do not need to address these messages
with any manual changes to the app. However, you can delete the messages from
the Configuration XML for the app if you want to.

[[message_types]]
In the Configuration XML file for the output project, you see any `WARN` or `ERROR`
notices. For example, see the `Migration WARN:` messages and links in the
migrated Choice router:

The Migration report links to information on any post-migration steps you need
to perform, for example:
