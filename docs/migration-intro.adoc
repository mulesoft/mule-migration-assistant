Mule 4 introduces a number of improvements over Mule 3, including:

* Easier and faster app development
* Seamless access and data mapping
* Simplified connectivity
* Auto-tuned and highly performant runtime
* Seamless upgrades of runtime and connector versions
* Up to 50% fewer steps and concepts to learn than Mule 3

== Migration Options

For your Mule 3 apps to take advantage of these and other benefits, you can migrate your apps to Mule 4 through one of the following processes:

* A fully manual migration of connectors, modules, transports, expressions, and API gateways to their Mule 4 counterparts (see https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-runtime/4.3/migration-process[Manual Migration Process Overview (external link)]).
* A partially automated migration by using the Mule Migration Assistant (MMA), which
is available as an open source project here on GitHub, in this `mule-migration-assistant` repository.
+
Important::
*Mule Migration Assistant (MMA) is subject to the terms and conditions described for https://www.mulesoft.com/legal/versioning-back-support-policy#community[Community] connectors.*
+
MuleSoft suggests that you try MMA to determine whether you prefer it to a fully manual migration.
Note that you can try out MMA on a sample application by following the steps
in the xref:user-docs/migration-tutorial.adoc[Mule Migration Assistant Tutorial].

== Understand the MMA Migration Process

Before beginning the migration process on your Mule 3 apps, review documentation on how to
prepare for the migration and understand the basic steps of the migration.
